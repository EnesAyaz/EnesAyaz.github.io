### Long Story Short

Hello, and welcome to my humble abode! Here, I will be sharing the ups and downs of my formal and informal life with you.

Let me start by telling you a little about myself. I was born and raised in the beautiful city, Giresun, located in the northern region of Turkey. The harmonious blend of sea and rain made for a picturesque childhood that I will always cherish.

Fast forward many years, and I found myself enrolled in the Middle East Technical University (METU), situated in the bustling capital city, Ankara. Known for its excellent technical education, METU was the perfect place for me to pursue my academic dreams.

I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2019 and 2022, respectively. 
I worked as a teaching assistant at the same department during my master's time. 
Parallelly, I had begun working at METU Powerlab as a research assistant. 
This lab opened up a world of opportunities for me to grow both personally and professionally.

But not enough about me! On this blog, I will be sharing my interests with you - from academia and music to classes and Aikido. This is my personal space, and I am excited to share my passions with you. So sit back, relax, and let's dive into the wonderful world of my experiences.
