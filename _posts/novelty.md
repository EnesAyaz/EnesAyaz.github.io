# Finding Novel Ideas

Finding novel ideas to contribute to the literature can be a challenging task, but with a bit of creativity and persistence, it's possible to develop original and innovative research ideas. Here are some tips on how to find novel ideas to add to the literature:

Start with a broad topic: Begin by selecting a broad topic that you're interested in and that has not been extensively researched. This will give you a starting point to work from and allow you to explore different avenues of research.

Conduct a literature review: A literature review is an essential step in developing novel ideas. It allows you to see what has already been researched and identify gaps in the literature. Look for areas where there is limited research or conflicting findings, as these can be good opportunities to develop novel ideas.

Attend conferences and workshops: Attending conferences and workshops is a great way to stay up-to-date with the latest research in your field and to network with other researchers. These events can also provide inspiration for new research ideas and collaborations.

Collaborate with other researchers: Collaborating with other researchers can help you develop novel ideas by bringing together different perspectives and areas of expertise. Consider working with researchers from different disciplines or institutions to generate new research ideas.

Explore emerging technologies or methodologies: Emerging technologies or methodologies can offer new opportunities for research. Look for areas where these technologies or methodologies are being used and consider how they could be applied to your own research.

Keep an open mind: Be open to new ideas and perspectives. Sometimes the most novel ideas come from unexpected sources or by looking at a problem from a different angle.

Use brainstorming techniques: Brainstorming techniques, such as mind mapping or free writing, can help you generate new ideas and make connections between different concepts.

Seek feedback: Share your ideas with colleagues, mentors, or other researchers in your field to get feedback and suggestions for further development.

In summary, finding novel ideas to add to the literature requires creativity, persistence, and a willingness to explore new avenues of research. By conducting a thorough literature review, attending conferences and workshops, collaborating with others, exploring emerging technologies or methodologies, keeping an open mind, using brainstorming techniques, and seeking feedback, you can develop original and innovative research ideas that contribute to the literature.

# Skimming the Literature

Reading scientific articles can be an intimidating task, but it's a crucial part of any academic or scientific research. In order to effectively find and read scientific articles, it's important to follow a few key steps. In this blog post, we'll outline a step-by-step guideline for finding and reading scientific articles.

Step 1: Determine what you're looking for

The first step in finding and reading scientific articles is to determine what you're looking for. Are you searching for a specific topic or research question? Or are you looking to explore a particular field? By understanding what you want to find, you can narrow your search and find relevant articles.

Step 2: Use a database

Once you know what you're looking for, it's time to start searching. One of the best ways to find scientific articles is to use a database such as IEEE, IET, Google Scholar, or ScienceDirect. These databases allow you to search for articles by keywords, authors, and journal titles.

Step 3: Refine your search

After conducting your initial search, you may find that you have too many articles to read through. To narrow down your results, try using advanced search options or Boolean operators (such as AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search.

Step 4: Read the abstract

When you've found an article that looks interesting, start by reading the abstract. The abstract provides a brief summary of the article and can help you determine if it's relevant to your research question.

Step 5: Skim the introduction and conclusion

After reading the abstract, skim through the introduction and conclusion to get a better sense of the article's main arguments and findings.

Step 6: Read the results and methods

If the article seems relevant to your research question, read the results and methods sections in detail. These sections describe the research design, methodology, and findings of the study.

Step 7: Evaluate the article

Once you've read the article, it's important to evaluate its quality and relevance. Consider the author's credentials, the journal in which the article was published, and the methodology used in the study.

Step 8: Take notes

As you read the article, take notes on the main arguments, findings, and limitations of the study. These notes can help you when you're writing your own research paper or preparing for an exam.

By following these steps, you can effectively find and read scientific articles. Whether you're a student or a researcher, reading scientific articles is an essential part of staying up-to-date with the latest research and developing your own expertise in a particular field.
